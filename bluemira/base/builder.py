class ComponentManager(abc.ABC):
    """
    A wrapper around a component tree.

    The purpose of the classes deriving from this is to abstract away
    the structure of the component tree and provide access to a set of
    its features. This way a reactor build procedure can be completely
    agnostic of the structure of component trees, relying instead on
    a set of methods implemented on concrete `ComponentManager`
    instances.

    This class can also be used to hold 'construction geometry' that may
    not be part of the component tree, but was useful in construction
    of the tree, and could be subsequently useful (e.g., an equilibrium
    can be solved to get a plasma shape, the equilibrium is not
    derivable from the plasma component tree, but can be useful in
    other stages of a reactor build procedure).

    Parameters
    ----------
    component_tree: Component
        The component tree this manager should wrap.
