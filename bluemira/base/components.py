    The Component is the fundamental building block for a bluemira reactor design. It
    encodes the way that the corresponding part of the reactor will be built, along with
    any other derived properties that relate to that component.

    Components define a tree structure, based on the parent and children properties. This
    allows the nodes on that tree to be passed around within bluemira so that
    operations can be performed on the child branches of that structure.

    For example, a reactor design including just a TFCoilSystem may look as below:

    .. digraph:: base_component_tree

      "FusionPowerPlant" -> "TFCoilSystem" -> {"TFWindingPack" "TFCasing"}

    A Component cannot be used directly - only subclasses should be instantiated.
